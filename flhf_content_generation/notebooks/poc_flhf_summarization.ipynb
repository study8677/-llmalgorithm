    "# API-based FLHF for Personalized Content Generation (Proof-of-Concept)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a simplified proof-of-concept (PoC) of an API-based Federated Learning with Human Feedback (FLHF) system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The system simulates an environment where:\n",
    "- Clients interact with a powerful, centralized Large Language Model (LLM) via a simulated API for content generation.\n",
    "- Each client has a local, smaller *auxiliary model* (`AuxiliaryPromptStrategyModel`). This model learns to select effective prompt templates and keywords to guide the LLM.\n",
    "- Federated Learning (FL) is used to aggregate updates for these auxiliary models from multiple clients.\n",
    "- Human Feedback (HF), simulated here, is used to train the auxiliary models on the client-side, improving their ability to guide the LLM towards desired outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal is to show the end-to-end execution flow of this API-based FLHF process. The auxiliary model, LLM API, client training, and feedback mechanisms are placeholders."

    "- Initialization of server, clients, LLM API simulator, and feedback simulator.\n",
    "- Progression through federated learning rounds.\n",
    "- For each client in each round:\n",
    "    - Setting of the global auxiliary model.\n",
    "    - Generation of content via the (simulated) LLM API, guided by the client's auxiliary model (which selects prompt templates/keywords).\n",

    "**Further Analysis (Beyond Current Scope):**\n",
    "In a more developed system, analysis would involve:\n",
    "- Evaluating the performance of the auxiliary model (e.g., does it learn to select templates/keywords that lead to higher feedback scores?).\n",
    "- Assessing the quality of the content generated by the LLM as guided by the trained auxiliary models (e.g., using task-specific metrics like ROUGE for summarization, or human evaluation).\n",
    "- Tracking the loss of the auxiliary model during training.\n",
    "- Comparing different feedback mechanisms or auxiliary model architectures."

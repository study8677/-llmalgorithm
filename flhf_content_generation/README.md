# FLHF for Personalized Content Generation via Large Model APIs

## 1. Overview
This project explores Federated Learning with Human Feedback (FLHF) for personalized content generation, simulating an environment where clients interact with a powerful, centralized Large Language Model (LLM) (e.g., GPT-3/4 like) via an API for content generation. The FLHF mechanism is employed to train or fine-tune a *smaller auxiliary model* or a *prompting strategy* on the client-side. These auxiliary components are then aggregated on the server-side (or kept local if personalization is key) to help personalize, guide, or adapt the output from the main LLM to specific user needs or contexts, without directly fine-tuning the LLM itself.

## 2. Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

## 3. Core Components

*   **`src/federated_learning/model.py`**: Defines `AuxiliaryPromptStrategyModel` (example name), representing the smaller, client-side model or prompt engineering strategy. This component is what gets updated through the FLHF process.
*   **`src/federated_learning/client.py`**: Defines the `Client` class. Clients use their local auxiliary model/strategy to formulate effective prompts, query the central (simulated) LLM API for content generation, receive human feedback on the generated content, and then train/update their auxiliary model/strategy based on this feedback.
*   **`src/federated_learning/server.py`**: Defines the `Server` class, now responsible for aggregating updates for the distributed auxiliary models or prompt strategies from the clients.
*   **`src/feedback/feedback_simulator.py`**: Defines `FeedbackSimulator` to mimic human feedback (scores, preferences) on content generated by the LLM.
*   **`src/data_utils.py`**: Provides utility functions for data handling, primarily for loading data relevant to training the auxiliary model/prompt strategy (e.g., prompts, feedback data, context).
*   **`src/llm_api_simulator.py`**: Simulates the behavior and responses of a powerful, general-purpose LLM API. This allows for development and testing without actual API costs or dependencies.
*   **`src/flhf_process.py`**: Contains `run_flhf_simulation`, the main script that orchestrates the entire FLHF process. This now includes clients formulating prompts, querying the simulated LLM API, receiving feedback, updating their auxiliary models/strategies, and server-side aggregation.

## 4. Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Python 3.x (e.g., Python 3.7+)

2.  **Clone the repository (if applicable)**:
    ```bash
    # git clone <repository_url>
    # cd flhf_content_generation
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Currently, `requirements.txt` is minimal and might primarily include `torch`.

## 5. Running the Proof-of-Concept

The proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates the API-based FLHF flow using dummy data, a simulated LLM API, and placeholder auxiliary model logic.

1.  Navigate to the `notebooks` directory:
    ```bash
    cd flhf_content_generation/notebooks
    ```
2.  Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook poc_flhf_summarization.ipynb
    # or
    # jupyter lab poc_flhf_summarization.ipynb
    ```
3.  Open `poc_flhf_summarization.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially. The notebook handles necessary imports and uses the `run_flhf_simulation` function, adapted for the new API-based flow.

    *Note*: The import paths in the notebook are configured assuming it is run from the `notebooks` directory or that the project root is correctly added to `sys.path`.

## 6. Running Tests

Unit tests are provided to verify the functionality of individual components.

1.  Navigate to the project's root directory (`flhf_content_generation`):
    ```bash
    cd path/to/flhf_content_generation
    ```
2.  Run the tests using Python's `unittest` module:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover tests
    ```
    This command will automatically discover and run all test files (named `test_*.py`) in the `tests` directory. (Tests will need to be updated to reflect changes in component interactions).

## 7. Future Work / Current Status

This project has been refocused to simulate an FLHF process interacting with a powerful LLM via an API, training an auxiliary model/prompt strategy. The core architecture for this simulation is in place.

Key areas for future development include:
*   **Implement Sophisticated Auxiliary Models**: Develop more advanced auxiliary models (e.g., small neural networks for prompt parameterization, rule-based systems, or learnable prompt embeddings).
*   **Develop Diverse Prompt Engineering Strategies**: Explore and implement various learnable prompt engineering strategies that can be optimized via FLHF.
*   **Refine LLM API Simulator**: Enhance `llm_api_simulator.py` for more realistic LLM behavior, including simulating different response styles, latencies, and potential API errors.
*   **Implement Client-Side Auxiliary Model Training**: Develop the actual training loop within the `Client` for updating the auxiliary model/strategy based on feedback and LLM responses.
*   **Advanced Feedback Integration**: Explore more nuanced ways to integrate human feedback into the auxiliary model/prompt strategy training.
*   **Real Dataset Integration**: Use real-world prompt datasets, user preferences, and contextual information to drive the simulation.
*   **Integration with Actual LLM APIs (Optional/Experimental)**: If feasible and resources allow, explore integrating with actual LLM APIs for validation.
*   **Evaluation Metrics**: Define and implement metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the auxiliary model/prompt strategy in improving LLM output personalization and quality.
*   **Configuration Management**: Introduce a more robust configuration system.
*   **Logging and Experiment Tracking**: Integrate comprehensive logging and experiment tracking.

# FLHF for Personalized Content Generation

## 1. Overview
This project aims to explore Federated Learning with Human Feedback (FLHF) for personalized content generation tasks. It provides a foundational framework for simulating FLHF scenarios, focusing on a sequence-to-sequence task like text summarization as an initial proof-of-concept.

## 3. Core Components

*   **`src/federated_learning/model.py`**: Defines `SimpleSeq2SeqModel`, a basic sequence-to-sequence neural network. Currently, its forward pass is a placeholder.
*   **`src/federated_learning/client.py`**: Defines the `Client` class, which manages local model training, content generation, and interaction with the server. Local training and content generation methods are placeholders.
*   **`src/federated_learning/server.py`**: Defines the `Server` class, responsible for global model aggregation (e.g., using Federated Averaging - FedAvg).
*   **`src/feedback/feedback_simulator.py`**: Defines `FeedbackSimulator` to mimic human feedback, providing scores or preferences for generated content.
*   **`src/data_utils.py`**: Provides utility functions for data handling, most notably `get_dummy_dataloaders`, which generates placeholder data for clients, and `TextDataset` for creating PyTorch datasets.
*   **`src/flhf_process.py`**: Contains `run_flhf_simulation`, the main script that orchestrates the entire FLHF process, including client initialization, training rounds, feedback collection, and server aggregation.

## 4. Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Python 3.x (e.g., Python 3.7+)

2.  **Clone the repository (if applicable)**:
    ```bash
    # git clone <repository_url>
    # cd flhf_content_generation
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Currently, `requirements.txt` is minimal and might primarily include `torch`.

## 5. Running the Proof-of-Concept

The proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates the basic FLHF flow using dummy data and placeholder model logic.

1.  Navigate to the `notebooks` directory:
    ```bash
    cd flhf_content_generation/notebooks
    ```
2.  Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook poc_flhf_summarization.ipynb
    # or
    # jupyter lab poc_flhf_summarization.ipynb
    ```
3.  Open `poc_flhf_summarization.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially. The notebook handles necessary imports and uses the `run_flhf_simulation` function.

    *Note*: The import paths in the notebook are configured assuming it is run from the `notebooks` directory or that the project root is correctly added to `sys.path`.

## 6. Running Tests

Unit tests are provided to verify the functionality of individual components.

1.  Navigate to the project's root directory (`flhf_content_generation`):
    ```bash
    cd path/to/flhf_content_generation
    ```
2.  Run the tests using Python's `unittest` module:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover tests
    ```
    This command will automatically discover and run all test files (named `test_*.py`) in the `tests` directory.

## 7. Future Work / Current Status

This project is currently a foundational setup with placeholder logic in many critical areas. The primary focus has been on establishing the overall architecture and simulation flow.

Key areas for future development include:
*   **Implement Model Logic**: Replace the placeholder `forward` pass in `SimpleSeq2SeqModel` with actual encoder-decoder logic (e.g., using LSTM or Transformer layers).
*   **Implement Client Training**: Develop the `train_local_model` method in `Client` with a proper training loop, loss calculation, and backpropagation.
*   **Implement Content Generation**: Flesh out the `generate_content` method in `Client` for actual sequence generation.
*   **Sophisticated Feedback Mechanisms**: Enhance `FeedbackSimulator` with more realistic feedback models. Integrate mechanisms for clients to utilize this feedback to update their models (e.g., basic reinforcement learning from rewards, or supervised fine-tuning on preferred samples).
*   **Real Dataset Integration**: Replace dummy data with actual datasets for content generation tasks (e.g., news articles for summarization). Update `data_utils.py` accordingly.
*   **Advanced RLHF Algorithms**: Explore and implement more advanced Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms (e.g., PPO for policy updates based on feedback).
*   **Evaluation Metrics**: Implement and track relevant metrics (e.g., ROUGE for summarization, perplexity, user satisfaction proxies) to evaluate model performance and the impact of FLHF.
*   **Configuration Management**: Introduce a more robust configuration system (e.g., using YAML files or dedicated config objects).
*   **Logging and Experiment Tracking**: Integrate comprehensive logging and experiment tracking tools (e.g., TensorBoard, MLflow).

        Placeholder for the forward pass of the Seq2Seq model.

        The actual implementation will involve:
        1. Encoding the source sequence.
        2. Initializing the decoder with the encoder's final state.
        3. Generating the target sequence token by token, using teacher forcing
           during training if `trg_seq` is provided.

        Args:
            src_seq (torch.Tensor): The source sequence tensor.
                                    Shape: (batch_size, src_seq_len).
            trg_seq (torch.Tensor, optional): The target sequence tensor, used
                                              during training with teacher forcing.
                                              Shape: (batch_size, trg_seq_len).
                                              Defaults to None (for inference).
            teacher_forcing_ratio (float, optional): The probability of using
                                                     teacher forcing. 0.5 means
                                                     half the time true target
                                                     tokens will be fed to the
                                                     decoder. Defaults to 0.5.

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor or None: Currently returns None. In a full implementation,
                                  this would be the output tensor from the decoder,
                                  typically logits over the target vocabulary.
